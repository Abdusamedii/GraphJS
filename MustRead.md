# GraphJS
Converting my Java software of graphing mathematical functions into JS, v0.0.4

How to use the Limit section:
on "x->" type where is x attempting to, if infinity simply time "inf"
when plugging "y=" do not forget to put every function in "()" braces, for example:   "a-x^2/x^2-a" should be written as : "(a-(x^2))/((x^2)-a)"     (a) standing for a constant.
